# alitext
An alias-based alias-making program and experimental language

Works on Linux

To run, you need to have at least python 3.5 installed.
You also need the ```pyperclip``` python library. Install it with ```sudo pip3 install pyperclip```

The program works to read files of .atxt
The language creates functions and aliases custom-made either to be copied, printed, executed, or added to ~/.bash_aliases.

To start the setup, type bash setup. Then, read COMMANDS.md for the commands.

SETUP NOT READY. RAW FILES CAN BE EXECUTED BY PUTTING THE FILENAME INTO .tmp_atxt. THEN, RUN ALITEXT.PY
